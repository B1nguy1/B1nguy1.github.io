# Is San Francisco a safe city to visit?

### Introduction

This assignment will also look at and analyze the dataset _Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018_ provided by DataSF. The Data we will look into will be limited to 2010-2017. The dataset provided contains reported crimes in the city and the county of **San Francisco**. In the dataset, we can find attributes such as location, date and type of crime. This allows us to analyze and have a good overview of crime statistics of San Francisco. Between 2010 and 2017 there were reported 1129383 crimes. The dataset also contains 37 different crime types.

### Background

San Francisco is one of the destination in the US that is popular for tourisms. The city offers many attractions and is known for its diverse culture. Golden Gate Bridge as you might heard about or Alcatraz Island is one of the reason to why one should visit San Francisco. Unfortunately, like other cities in the US, some tourisms might wonder if San Francisco is a safe city. As a tourist, one wants to feel safe when walking in the streets. For that reason, I want to use the collected data of reported crimes of San Francisco to find out if San Francisco is a safe city to visit. Crime types that are common against tourists might be property robbery and larceny/theft.

### Analysis of SF Data

To find out if San Francisco is a safe city to visit, we are going to visualize the data.
The first visualization shows occurences of robbery crimes from 2010 to 2017.

<figcaption>Plot 1: Occurrences of robbery crimes 2010-2017 </figcaption>

The plot that has been created is a line chart showing the number of occurences of robberies from 2010 to 2017.
From the plot, one can observed that robbery crimes increased from 2010 to 2013 where its peak was in 2013 before decreased in 2014. One factor to why the robbery crimes increased from 2010 to 2013 might be the fact that there is income inequality between people in San Francisco. This means that there are a mixed of rich people and those who live in poverty.

The second visualization is a map of San Francisco that shows robbery crimes of different districts. As the number of robbery crimes was at its peak in 2013 and decreased in 2014, we will go deeper into this subset of data to find out the areas one should be careful when walking in the streets.

**Plot 2:** _Map showing occurences of robbery crimes in different districts in SF 2013-2014_
<br>

From the visualization, there is clear that districts _Mission_ and _Southern_ are those with high numbers of robberies. For tourists, there is therefore best to be avoid to walk around there, especially at night. As those districts are not popular by tourists according to an article about _Best San Francisco Districts to Visit: 10 Most Popular_, tourists can be sure that there is low risk to face robbery crimes when they are in San Francisco.

The third and final visualization, is an interactive visualization of a bar chart showing robbery and theft crime rates monthly between 2013 and 2014. To see the crime rate of different crime categories, one can select or remove crime categories from the legend.

**Plot 3:** _Interactive visualization of robbery and theft crime rates_

From the visualization, there is in general low crime rate through winter and spring, but high crime rate during autumn. The fact that the crime rate is high, might be that there is a lot of tourists that visit San Francisco during this season. According to the article _Best Times To Visit San Francisco_ by USNews the best month to visit San Francisco is from September to November.

### Conclusion

In this analysis of San Francisco dataset now, we have explored and seen robbery and theft as crime types. The analysis shows that there is still high crime rate in San Francisco, especially in crime type _LARCENY/THEFT_. In general, San Francisco is a safe city to visit as a tourist. However, one should always keep in mind when walking in areas. Especially areas where there are many tourists, there is high risk to face again thefts. The collected data by Police Department of San Francisco that has been analyzed and visualized can hopefully make us to better understand where the crimes are most occurred. This will help the police department to do measures to reduce crimes in San Francisco.
