# Where should one be located in San Francisco?

### Introduction

This assignment will also look at and analyze the dataset _Police Department Incident Reports: Historical 2003 to May 2018_ provided by DataSF. The Data we will look into will be limited to 2010-2017. The dataset provided contains reported crimes in the city and the county of **San Francisco**. In the dataset, we can find attributes such as location, date and type of crime. This allows us to analyze and have a good overview of crime statistics of San Francisco.

### The story

As the assignment 2 is about to create a short data story, I want therefore to create a story related to tourisms. Like other cities in the US, tourisms might wonder if San Francisco is a safe city to visit. When visiting a city, one always want to feel safe when walking in the streets. Therefore, I want to use the collected data of San Francisco reported crimes to find out which areas and when tourisms should avoid to visit. This is so tourisms can have a nice experience when they spend their time in San Francisco. For the dataset, I wanted to look reported crimes between years 2010 and 2017. Between 2010 and 2017 there were reported 1129383 crimes. The dataset also contains 37 different crime types. By all the crime types, types of crimes that might be interesting to take a closer look at are robbery and larceny/theft.
